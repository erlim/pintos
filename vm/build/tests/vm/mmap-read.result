FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mmap-read) begin
  (mmap-read) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-read) mmap "sample.txt"
  (mmap-read) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-read) begin
  (mmap-read) open "sample.txt"
  (mmap-read) mmap "sample.txt"
- (mmap-read) end
+ failed to syscall, cuz of invailed syscall

(Process exit codes are excluded for matching purposes.)
